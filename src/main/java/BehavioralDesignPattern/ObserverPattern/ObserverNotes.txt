Defines a one to many dependency -> if one object change all of its dependency are notified automatically

The observers rely/depend on the subjects

        why is it good? loose coupling !!!
            - when two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact but they have little knowledge of each other
            - the only thing the subject know about an observer is that it implements a certain interface
            - we can add observers whenever we want: just have to implements the observer interface
            - we can independently reuse subjects or observers
            - we can change the subject or observer independently

        loosely coupled design is very good: we can build flexible systems that can handle change because the
        interdependency between objects are minimal.

very important principle in design -> use loosely coupled designs between objects that interacts
