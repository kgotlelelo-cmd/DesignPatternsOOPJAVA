Command pattern -> we can encapsulate method invocation,it encapsulate a request as an object

        Good -> the object invoking the computation know nothing about the implementation

            4 components: command, receiver, invoker and client

                Command: knows about receiver and invokes a method of the receiver
                    values for parameters of the receiver method are stored in the command !!!

                    Receiver: does the work itself

                    Invoker: knows how to execute a command, and optionally does bookkeeping about the command !!!


        The invoker does not know anything about a concrete command, it knows only about command interface !!!

                    Client: The client decides which commands to execute at which points
                            To execute a command, it passes the command object to the invoker object
